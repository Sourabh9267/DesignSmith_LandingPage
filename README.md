Landing Page Design - Code Implementation
Overview
A few days ago, I came across a landing page design template on Freepik that really caught my eye. Inspired by its clean and modern look, I decided to take on the challenge of transforming the design into code.

What I Did
I used the design as a reference to create a landing page from scratch. After completing the development, I pushed the code to this GitHub repository for anyone interested in viewing or using it.

What is expected
next thing i am looking forward to make it responsive for mobile devices.

Technologies Used

How to Use
